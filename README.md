# MQGenerator_CodeLou

Rabbit MQ Generator is a Winform application that will generate multiple unique MQ messages.

Installation:

To Run:
1. Start Program and select a queue from the dropdown.
2. Select number of msgs
3. Hit Start

The program will generate a message with the current date/time and continue generating messages as indicated by the user with one second increments. 
Messages will be printed to the console to be copy/pasted to Rabbit MQ (program to be improved to automatically deliver to the rabbit queue in the future.)

Code Louisville Requirements:

**Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

**Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

**Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
